      <description>Let’s play with the Titanic data from Kaggle. In this first (blogged) data project, my goals are to explore the data, engineer some basic features, build a few basic models, and compare their fit. Thus, my overall aim is to get a pipeline running and skip tweaking details (fine-tuning models and features) for now.
Preparations: clear workspace, detach packages, prepare custom plotting theme.
# clear the workspace. rm(list = ls()) # detach packages to avoid interferences.</description>

      <description>Customizing ggplots by hand works fine, but can be tideous if you’re doing it over and over again during a project (which I have). Therefore, creating a custom ggplot theme that includes adaptations of style/ colour and that can be stored and loaded on demand has been on my to do list for a while. This seems like a good place to start a blog… So here it comes.
Preparations: load the ggplot2 package.</description>
